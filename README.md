### Overview

The FLAMES game is a popular and whimsical pastime, often embraced for its entertainment value. Represented by the acronym "FLAMES," the game delves into the categories of Friends, Lovers, Affectionate, Marriage, Enemies, and Siblings. While it's essential to understand that FLAMES is not designed as a serious relationship predictor, it stands out as a delightful way to share laughter among friends.

### Operational Process

- #### Name Input:
Participants kick off the game by submitting two names.

- #### Common Character Exclusion:
The program systematically removes shared characters and tallies the unique characters in the provided names.

- #### Letter Elimination:
Leveraging the count of remaining characters, the program iteratively erases letters from "FLAMES."

### Result Determination:
The ultimate surviving letter corresponds to one of six categories: 
- Friends
- Lovers
- Affectionate
- Marriage
- Enemies
- Siblings

The determined outcome is then presented to the participants, adding an element of amusement to the experience.
